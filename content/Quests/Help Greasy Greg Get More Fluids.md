Greasy Greg is an antisocial hermit who lives in a house at the edge of the forest to the northeast of town.  He is always on the lookout for interesting liquids, and usually has a checklist of creatures he needs "milked" in case the party wants to earn some cash, brew interesting potions, or just help out their old pal Greg.
