Foke is a farmer who lives near the fishing outpost of [[Grey Hawk]]. His property border's Nira's and he is a mostly friendly neighbor, as long as the sheep droppings stay on the OTHER side of the fence. Foke never married and handles the farm by himself, so he rarely has time to do much of anything during the planting or harvest season. He often has entries in agricultural fairs in the area, and makes a mean corn soup. When he took part in the town tradition of going over the falls in a barrel as a young man his barrel split open and he nearly drowned, and hasn't been fully right in the head since.
