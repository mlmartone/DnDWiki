The owner and barkeep at [[The Bursting Barrel]], the local rough-and-tumble tavern in [[Grey Hawk]]. She has seen everything come through her doors at least once, but runs a tight ship, taking pride in her establishment as the gathering place of the locals. She knows everyone in town and has a big heart, but isn't above charging double if you're too drunk too notice.
