The Reeve of [[Grey Hawk]] is an inherited title that is somewhat akin to a mayor, but the town's distance from major cities makes it a largely libertarian settlement.  The Reeve is responsible for upkeeping the bridge, collecting tolls, overseeing a small contingent of town guards, and settling disputes that can't be handled between citizens.  Featuring three stories, a fenced in yard, a fountain fed by the nearby river, and it's own small stable, this is the most opulent building in the town, but it is certainly no lord's keep.  The current resident is [[Reeve Fona Goldcrest]], along with her husband and son who is currently in Waterdeep finishing his studies.
