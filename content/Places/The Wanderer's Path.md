The Long Path is a famous adventuring road that leads down the fabled sword coast from Mirabar to Waterdeep.  It is the inland route parallel to the High Road.  The Wanderer's Path is a trail that splits off of the Long Path somewhere to the southwest of  the Sword Mountains, heading up along the edge of [[The High Forest]] and crossing the [[Dessarin River]] at the village of [[Grey Hawk]].  It is lightly traveled, but not known to be a particularly dangerous route, making it ideal for travelers hoping to go inland into Faerun from the Sword Coast.
